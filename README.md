# Machine Learning Classification Project - School Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating baseline classification models after cleaning and preprocessing the data.

## Project Overview

### Data Cleaning:
- Dealing with NaN values.
- Handling categorical features to ensure the data is ready for machine learning models.

### Model Definition and Evaluation:
We defined and evaluated several baseline classification models, including:
- **SVM**
- **RandomForestClassifier**
- **GradientBoostingClassifier**
- **AdaBoostClassifier**
- **DecisionTreeClassifier**

### Hyperparameter Tuning:
After identifying the best-performing baseline model, we performed hyperparameter tuning to improve its accuracy and overall performance.

The project involved a systematic approach to data preparation, model evaluation, and optimization to ensure accurate classification results.
